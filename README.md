# Dylan Wilson's 2020 Project's
Here are all of the projects I have and will create during the year 2020.

I am starting of the year mainly coding basic python applications and then moving onto more advanced python applications and libraries including Tkinter later in the year. Although I am trying to create a website for all of my projects and stream myself creating them on Twitch, and uploading highlights to YouTube.

Feel free to have a look round this repository, you are free to use any of my code just make sure to credit me as the author.
